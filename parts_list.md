# High Voltage Multiplier Learning Project
This project documents a hobby-level high voltage generation experiment using:
- 12V battery input
- ZVS flyback driver
- Flyback transformer
- Cockcroft–Walton voltage multiplier stages
⚠️ This is a learning project focused on theory, block design, and safe lab practice.
No one should attempt high-voltage construction without proper supervision and equipment.
