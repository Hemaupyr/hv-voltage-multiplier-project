# Theory Overview
## Flyback Transformer
Steps up high-frequency AC into kilovolt range using magnetic induction.
## ZVS Driver
Zero Voltage Switching oscillator that efficiently drives the flyback.
## Cockcroft–Walton Multiplier
A diode-capacitor ladder network that multiplies peak AC voltage into higher DC voltage.
Vout ≈ 2 × N × Vin_peak
